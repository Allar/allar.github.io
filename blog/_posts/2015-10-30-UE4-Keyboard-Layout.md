I made a custom WASD keycap set using the templates over at [WASD Keyboards](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/) for my Das Keyboard. I just ordered the set, if it turns out well, I plan on hosting the source template files on [my github](http://www.github.com/allar). For now though, it can be used as a pretty handy reference in image form. Here you go!
