I released some unmaintained but stable code that adds some predefined extended UMG widgets to Unreal Engine 4 that support things like dynamic widget creation, beter skinning support, and a few other features discussed in the way too long video shown above. Source for this has also been released on [my github](http://github.com/Allar).
