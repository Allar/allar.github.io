title: "Just A Thought: LaTeX for Kids"
---

Just a thought. Inspired by a friend of mine's post on Facebook, I believe we should embed android tablets into the desks of schools and teach kids in their very first year of school how to answer math problems with LaTeX. The ability to deconstruct mathematics into an alternate language would only improve mathematics comprehension. That and there are many things you can do if every kid has an embedded android tablet in their desk.
