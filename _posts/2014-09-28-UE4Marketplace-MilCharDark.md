## Summary

### Worth It?

If you are working on a third person project, yes. If not, I would hold out for a character pack that includes first person arms.

### Pros

- Cost effective
- Look Good within UE4
- 4K Diffuse and Normals
- Skinned to Epic's Animation Starter Pack Skeleton

### Cons

- 4K Mask texture could be 1K and still be of the same quality
- No geometry behind face masks
- Physics assets are **absolutely terrible**
- Female character's right arm clips in almost all animations
- First person arm meshes not included
