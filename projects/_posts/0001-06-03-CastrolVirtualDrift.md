Working with [Master of Shapes](http://masterofshapes.com/) for [Castrol](http://www.castrol.com/), I created the UE4 side of the Mustang to UE4 code used to drive input of a virtual car inside UE4 that would have its controls synced to a real world Mustang. I also was responsible for getting the Oculus Rift tracking working within a moving reference frame (a car) using an external 9DOF tracker.

There is nothing quite like driving a Mustang in Venice at night blind with vision replaced by an instance of UE4 running inside an Oculus Rift.

While the end result was 'prettied up' by Castrol Marketing, the underlying tech that allowed the driver to drive safely while blind is real. I know this because not only did I help create it, I drove with it.
