One Sunday I got fed up with the lack of usability updates regarding the UE4 Marketplace within the Epic Launcher. It has since then improved but there is still a lot more that could be done. I wanted to address its sluggishness, navigation issues, and add a few 'nice to haves'. The result of this was a fully working Marketplace browser that worked across Windows, OSX, and Linux. At the time of this writing the Epic Launcher still doesn't run on Linux and Linux users have to use another OS to get their marketplace purchases.

The only missing features making it from being usable is the downloading of assets you own. I have achieved this but have not posted code due to what I foresee as a possible security risk.

It ended up turning out really nice. Nice enough to get a good comment from [Tim Sweeney](https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?93657-Custom-UE4-Marketplace-Frontend-%28Full-Source-Available%29.&p=433273&viewfull=1#post433273) and kick off a job interview process for a position at Epic.
