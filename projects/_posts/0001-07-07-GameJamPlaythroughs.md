Starting November 2015, I have been streaming playthroughs of all entries to the [monthly Epic UE4 Game Jams](https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?96370-February-UE4jam-February-11-14th-THEME-ONE-HIT-WONDER) on [my Twitch channel](http://www.twitch.tv/awesomeallar).

These playthrough streams on average last around 16 continuous hours. They are great fun as the game jam teams tend to join in on the stream and we get to hear from the developers of the game jam entries while playing through their submissions.

Some cool things resulted from this, such as being able to [visit the Epic HQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGnx0LrCvZg) and being [a part of their livestreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoH0fD1kcRo).
