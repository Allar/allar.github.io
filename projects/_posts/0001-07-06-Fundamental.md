I used to do a lot of game jams early in my game dev career but after my time became eaten up with more and more client work, I took a break from them. After several months of my Game Jam playthrough streaming, many people kept asking me when I am going to submit an entry.

I happened to have two days free during the December 2015 UE4 Game Jam and figured that it was as good a time as any to see if I still got the chops for a game jam. The theme of the December 2015 UE4 Game Jam was "The End Is The Beginning", which naturally inspired the thought of mobius loops. I ended up playing with the idea of a track that folded on itself yet still had a continuous path with the ability to flip between 'top and bottom sides' even though if you never flipped you would traverse both sides. The end result ended up being a game I called Fundamental, a 'fill in the track while avoiding obstacles' game that ended up winning one of the three winner slots of the Game Jam.
