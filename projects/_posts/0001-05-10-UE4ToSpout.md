A lot of people asked me if its possible to pipe the output of UE4 to another app. A lot of Video Jockeys wanted support for Spout from UE4, and one weekend I decided to give it a go to see if it was possible.

I ended up with a proof of concept which you can [view on my YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy8NZFCBMm4).

I have since abandoned this project but there are a few continuing where I left off. Source code for this [is available on my Github](https://github.com/Allar/UE4ToSpout).
