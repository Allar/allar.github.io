Everyone knows I'm a zealot of Source Control. My weapon of choice is [Perforce](https://www.perforce.com/). I even have a very popular set of tutorials regarding how to set up [Perforce on Ubuntu using Digital Ocean](/2014/09/25/Setup-Perforce-Digital/).

The initial draft of the tutorial proved to be a little too technical for many people, so to reduce the barrier of entry to using Perforce, I created an [automatic Perforce setup script](https://github.com/Allar/linux-perforce-installer) that has gained quite a bit of traction. Once I did this, a large number of people started telling me they've adopted Perforce thanks to my guides.

I will keep fighting the good fight of getting people to use Source Control, whether Perforce or otherwise.
